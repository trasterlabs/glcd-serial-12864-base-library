# Legal Note

Legal note in the home page? YES!

Firstly, inform you that firmware is not software, firmware has warranties!

The firmware I made has no defects inside it if you follow the rules exactly as I describe it. If you have any malfunctions, I don't have any responsability if you mount incorrectly the wires, the solders, the connections or the jumpers or the microcontroller interface necessary to correctly function the device. Mount exactly as I tell you and I ensure -even in a court- that the firmware will function correctly. If anybody has defects, it would be the microcontroller, the wiring or the screen itself, not the firmware I created.

## Basic points of warranty:

 - I will only give a warranty support the first 3 years for each release. If you have any malfunction in the firmware I provide, please refer exactly the version you use related in the release notes. Only are valid for warranty purposes the releases in the releases zone.
 - The any branches that are no releases have no warranty of any kind (they could have potentially bugs could destroy devices or harm humans in the process). You could be sued back if you try to use any other firmware than the releases and be object of malfunctions, damage or loss. It's your responsability to ensure you know exactly what are you doing, not mine.
 - Use this firmware with code with other licenses is absolutely prohibited, except the standard libraries. Respect the authors! I try to respect them as hard as I do.
 - The use in private projects is prohibited except by agreement with the author, trasterlabs
 - Use in commercial projects is strictly prohibited. You must have an agreement with the autor trasterlabs in commercial terms to use this firmware in your commercial projects. Don't try to be smarter deleting the legal notes, my code has several indicators I am the owner.
 - You cannot use the firmware in any ways, but, if you want to use it and I grant you permission, you cannot create any explosive artifacts, like bombs or missiles, using my technology. I appreciate the human life and I don't get involved in any armed conflict of any kind. Respect my desires.
 - If your microcontroller has internal failures, your cables are defective, or use another models apart than the models I describe, or even try to use antoher model of GLCD, and try to sue me because you have a malfunction, I have no responsabilities for your bad use and you could be sued back. You didn't follow my instructions, the malfunction is only yours. The warranty does not apply bad uses from the hardware creator, maintainer, user or seller.
